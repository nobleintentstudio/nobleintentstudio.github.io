Personalization can be added to the subject line to push the recipients to open and read the email.</p><h2>3. Create a Prospects List</h2><p>For those new to the email marketing scene, a prospect list is just an email contact list of the people you intend to broadcast your messages to. One thing to take note of is that they are permission-based, so be sure you have permission to email these contacts. Also be sure to include an option to unsubscribe.

While creating these lists, ensure that they are sorted out, and narrowed down to businesses, groups, and other segments based on personal interests as applicable to your business.</p><h2>4. Create a Sense of Urgency</h2><p>One of the best ways to motivate and stimulate action is to create a feeling of urgency or an element of scarcity. Once you've demonstrated that you understand your recipients' problems or needs and that you are the right person to solve them, entice them to act quickly to take advantage of your offer. Communicate to them that the offer won't last long or there are limited offers remaining. The hope is the lead will transition into a client as fast as they can so that they don’t pass up a great opportunity.</p><h2>5. Be Brief</h2><p>B2B lead generation emails ought to be as brief as possible. It is assumed most people in a working environment are generally busy, and their time is too valuable to read through long emails. The main point of your email marketing messages should be communicated as concisely as possible. Be brief and concise with the words and expressions that you use. Rather than writing long phrases and whole paragraphs, use short sentences and paragraphs of just two to three sentences.</p><h2>6.
