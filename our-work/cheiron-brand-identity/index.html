All of the triangles are working together to distill a highly complex shape down to its simplest form in the most accurate and efficient way possible &mdash; communicating that you can accomplish something that’s highly complex if the pieces of the puzzle are&nbsp;accurate.<br><br>The centaur is depicted in an active stance &mdash; up on its hind legs with bow drawn. The bow and implied arrow are a visual metaphor for accuracy and trustworthiness &mdash; communicating there’s no one else you’d rather have by your side than someone this&nbsp;accurate.<br><br>The typeface used for the lettering portion of the logo accentuates the triangular form of the icon &mdash; see the points of the N, the R, and even the C. They echo the points in the triangles and unify the icon and wordmark as&nbsp;one.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-3.jpg" alt="Logo Concept B"><figcaption><b>Concept B</b><br>While still very stylized, this icon is more curvilinear in form and feels a little more naturalistic than the geometric form of concept&nbsp;A.<br><br>Again the figure is depicted in a very active stance — standing on his hind legs with arrow drawn. The bow and arrow serving once more as a visual metaphor for accuracy — you can trust this archer is going to hit his&nbsp;target.<br><br>This concept also evokes a very premium, high-end feeling. Cheiron is a high-end firm that hires the best people to tackle complexity and deal with high-profile clients. The style of this icon and the typeface used communicate these high-end&nbsp;attributes.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-4.jpg" alt="Logo Concept C"><figcaption><b>Concept C</b><br>The centaur icon is very geometric and mathematically based. It evokes a feeling of&nbsp;precision.<br><br>The icon is bound by a circle that is broken by the arrow point - drawing attention to the bow and arrow and the sentiment of&nbsp;accuracy.<br><br>The icon is abstract, but still very recognizable as a centaur. It provides a distinct&nbsp;look.</figcaption></figure><p>Though Concept A was a favorite of the CEO, the other stakeholders wanted something less abstract.</p><p>Our new parameters were to create a less abstract centaur icon and also include the original typographic treatment for the wordmark.</p><p>We arrived at a rectilinear centaur icon composed solely of straight lines &mdash; a departure from the more naturalistic, curvilinear form in their original logo, but still not as abstract as the early concepts.</p><img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-5.jpg" alt="Logo Concept D"><p>We adjusted the original wordmark to pair more effectively with the rectilinear shape of the icon.</p><img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-6.jpg" alt="Wordmark Revisions"><p>After unveiling the new concept to more of the employees, it was decided that the “C” from the wordmark should also serve as the bow and arrow as was done in the original logo.</p><img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-7.jpg" alt="Final Logo"><p>Once the logo was finalized, we moved on to color exploration. We adjusted the original teal color slightly and paired it with a dark blue and gold.</p><p>We then put together extensive branding guidelines to be used by employees and other marketing or design partners to ensure consistent and appropriate use of all branding elements.</p><img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-8.jpg" alt="Brand Guidelines p.1"> <img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-9.jpg" alt="Brand Guidelines p.2"> <img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-10.jpg" alt="Brand Guidelines p.3"><p>As our final stage in the rebranding process, we redesigned all of Cheiron’s digital and printed marketing collateral such as letterhead, business cards, report templates, PowerPoint presentations, and more.</p><img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-11.jpg" alt="Business System"> <img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-12.jpg" alt="Business Card"> <img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-13.jpg" alt="Report"> <img src="/img/studies/Cheiron/Cheiron-14.jpg" alt="Client Advisory Report"><p>We also worked with Cheiron to transition from emailed Word documents as internal quarterly newsletters, to ESP-managed HTML emails.</p><a href="/our-work" class="more-link">See All Case Studies</a></article><footer role="contentinfo"><div class="inner-content"><h1 class="main-heading">Get In Touch.</h1><div class="grid-wrapper"><div class="column-half"><p>Subscribe to our mailing list.</p><form action="https://nobleintentstudio.glitch.me/subscribe" method="POST" data-thanks="Thank you for subscribing to our email list.
